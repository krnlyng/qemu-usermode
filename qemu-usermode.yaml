Description: 
    QEMU is an extremely well-performing CPU emulator that allows you to  
    choose between simulating an entire system and running userspace  
    binaries for different architectures under your native operating  
    system. It currently emulates x86, ARM, PowerPC and SPARC CPUs as well  
    as PC and PowerMac systems.
